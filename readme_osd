       ./setup.sh


1. **Access PHP Pages:**
   Open a web browser and navigate to your Board IP address and specify /od.
   (eg. 192.168.0.108/od/index.php)   where 192.168.0.108 is your board ip address.


2. **Login as Admin:** Currently only 4 users are available and their credentials are listed below. You can login into OSD using them.
   On the Login page enter login credentials as:
    - Username: Admin
    - Password: Admin@123

    - Username: User2
    - Password: User2@12345

    - Username: User3
    - Password: User3@12345

    - Username: User4
    - Password: User4@12345

3. **OSD pages will display on the browser**

4. **Make changes on OSD:**  Currently Encoder1 is set to be viewed on the OSD.
    1. To access the video stream from Encoder1 you can navigate through:
    Port Access-> Encoder1 -> Click on Connect button.

**Working modules on OSD:**
  
   1. Streaming of video and audio on OSD.
   2. At a time 3 decoders can view 1 Encoder.
      
**Known Issues:**
   
   1. Delay in video streaming and distorted audio.
   2. Port Setting, Kvm setting, Maintainance and Help tabs are disabled. Currently these tabs won't be accessible.

- Ensure that file permissions are set correctly on the PHP files and directories.
- Verify that Nginx, MySQL, and PHP-FPM are all running and configured correctly.
